# Frontend Assignment Project

## Overview

This is a simple frontend project with a single route that directs to the main page. The project is built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery.

## Project Structure

The project directory contains the following files:

```
frontend-assignment/
├── index.html
├── css/
│   └── styles.css
├── js/
│   └── script.js
├── images/
│   └── (your image files)
└── README.md
```

- **index.html**: The main HTML file.
- **css/styles.css**: The CSS file for styling.
- **js/script.js**: The JavaScript file containing the jQuery code.
- **images/**: A directory for image assets (if any).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run this project, you need a web browser. No additional installations are required.

### Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/frontend-assignment.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd frontend-assignment
   ```

3. Open `index.html` in your web browser to view the project.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: For structuring the web page.
- **CSS**: For styling the web page.
- **JavaScript**: For adding interactive functionality.
- **jQuery**: A JavaScript library used to simplify DOM manipulation.

## Main Page

The main page includes:

- A header section.
- A main content section with a sample interactive element (e.g., a button that shows/hides content).
- A footer section.

### Sample jQuery Functionality

In `js/script.js`, you'll find a sample jQuery function:

```javascript
$(document).ready(function() {
    $("#toggleButton").click(function() {
        $("#content").toggle();
    });
});
```

This function toggles the visibility of an element with the ID `content` when a button with the ID `toggleButton` is clicked.

## Customization

Feel free to customize the project by:

- Modifying the HTML structure in `index.html`.
- Changing the styles in `css/styles.css`.
- Adding more interactive features in `js/script.js`.
